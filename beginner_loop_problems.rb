# Use an Each loop to solve the following problems.

# 1. Given an array of numbers, go through the list of numbers one at a time, if a number is greater than 100 then print “That’s high”, if the number is not greater than 100 print “I could go higher”

# 2. Given an array of numbers, go through the list of numbers one at a time, Print each number divided in half. It should print a whole number if the original number is even and the printed number should include a decimal if the original number was odd.

# 3. Take a string made of multiple words. Print the last letter of every word.

# 4. Do not use the method `include?` to solve this one. Make a method that accepts a string. Go through each letter and if the original string includes a “t” character return true otherwise return false.

# 5. An addition to problem 4, only return true if there are 3 or more “t”s in the original string, otherwise return false

#PROBLEM 1
# array = [1, 2, 4, 121, 333, 11, 444, 3]

# array.each do |number|
#   if number > 100
#     puts "That's High"
#   else
#     puts "I could go higher"
#   end
# end

#PROBLEM TWO 

array = [1, 2, 4, 121, 333, 11, 444, 3]
